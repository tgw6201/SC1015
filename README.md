# A project that analyses heart attack datasets and makes predictions base on data provided

About Dataset
* Age (Age of patient) (Numerical)
* Sex (Sex of patient 1 = Male, 2 = Female)  
* Exang (Exercise-induced angina, meaning chest pain when exercising 1 = Yes, 2 = No)
* ca (Number of major vessels (0-4) colored by flourosopy, 0 represents a higher likelihood of having heart diseases)
* cp (Chest pain type)  
  0: Typical angina  
  1: Atypical angina  
  2: Non-anginal pain  
  3. Asymptomatic  
* trtbps (resting blood pressure (in mm Hg))
* chol (cholestoral in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor)
* fbs ((fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false))
* rest-ecg  
  Value 0: normal  
  Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)  
  Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)  
* thalach (maximum heart rate achieved)
* target (0 = less chance of heart attack, 1 = more chance of heart attack)
